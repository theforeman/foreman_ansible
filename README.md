## Compatibility

| Foreman | Plugin    |
| ------: | --------: |
| >= 1.9  | 0 - 0.3   |
| >= 1.12 | 1.0 - TBD |

### Devs

The callback sends a POST request to /api/v2/hosts/facts with the format you can see [in the API docs](http://theforeman.org/api/1.9/apidoc/v2/hosts/facts.html).

Facts must contain the output of `ansible -m setup $HOSTNAME`, plus a '_type' and '_timestamp' keys. You can see an example on test/fixtures/sample_facts.json in this repository.

After that request, you should have a host registered in Foreman with the Ansible facts. It takes into account some facter and ohai facts if these are available on the system as well.
