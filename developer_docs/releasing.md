# Releasing new Ansible version
**Before checks**
* Check if Foremanâ€™s required version in [register.rb](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_ansible/blob/master/lib/foreman_ansible/register.rb) needs to be changed.
* In case you want to start doing the release in the same PR with another commit, make sure that the version bump in [version.rb](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_ansible/blob/master/lib/foreman_ansible/version.rb) is in a separate commit.
* All [redmine tickets](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/ansible/issues) have correct release version
* Correct versioning (see [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200))

```
X.0.0 - Required Foreman version have been changed
0.X.0 - Major feature have been merged
0.0.X - Small fix
