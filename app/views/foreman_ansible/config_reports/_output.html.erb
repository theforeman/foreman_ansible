<!--
We parse a few parts of the report log, to check if it's an Ansible report
An alternative to this would be to subclass Ansible < ConfigReport and change
the API endpoint at api/v2/config_reports to accept a :type argument with the
config management system type.
However, that solution breaks compatibility of this plugin with older versions
of Foreman that do not have that endpoint.
